## Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines

**Strict Type Safety**
```typescript
// Good: Explicit types and null checking
interface GenerationInput {
  domain: string;
  complexity: 'Beginner' | 'Intermediate' | 'Advanced';
  contextSetting: string;
}

function generateCaseStudy(input: GenerationInput): Promise<CaseStudy | null> {
  if (!input.contextSetting.trim()) {
    throw new Error('Context setting is required for case study generation');
  }
  // Implementation...
}

// Avoid: Any types and implicit nulls
function generateCase(input: any): any {
  // Implementation...
}
```

**Educational Domain Modeling**
```typescript
// Good: Clear educational concepts
interface PracticeSession {
  readonly id: number;
  readonly caseStudyId: number;
  readonly startTime: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  studentNotes: string;
  analyticalFrameworks: string[];
  completionStatus: 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'abandoned';
}

// Good: Educational validation
function validateCaseStudyContent(content: string): ValidationResult {
  const wordCount = content.split(/\s+/).length;
  const hasLearningObjectives = content.includes('learning objective');
  
  return {
    isValid: wordCount >= 200 && hasLearningObjectives,
    recommendations: generateQualityRecommendations(content)
  };
}
```

### React Component Standards

**Educational Component Design**
```typescript
// Good: Clear educational purpose and accessibility
interface PracticeViewProps {
  caseStudy: CaseStudy;
  onSessionComplete: (session: PracticeSession) => void;
  timerEnabled?: boolean;
  analyticalFrameworks: string[];
}

export const PracticeView: React.FC<PracticeViewProps> = ({
  caseStudy,
  onSessionComplete,
  timerEnabled = false,
  analyticalFrameworks
}) => {
  // Implementation with educational best practices
  return (
    <Box role="main" aria-label="Case Study Practice Session">
      <Typography variant="h4" component="h1">
        {caseStudy.title}
      </Typography>
      {/* Accessible, educational UI */}
    </Box>
  );
};
```

**State Management Best Practices**
```typescript
// Good: Educational state with clear actions
interface EducationalStore {
  // Student progress and learning data
  practiceProgress: PracticeProgress[];
  currentSession: PracticeSession | null;
  
  // Actions with educational context
  startPracticeSession: (caseStudyId: number) => void;
  updateStudentNotes: (notes: string) => void;
  completeAnalysis: (frameworks: string[], insights: string[]) => void;
}
```

### AI Integration Standards

**Educational AI Prompts**
```typescript
// Good: Educational prompt engineering
class EducationalPromptBuilder {
  buildCaseStudyPrompt(input: GenerationInput): string {
    return `
      Create an educational case study for ${input.domain} that:
      
      Educational Objectives:
      - Develops critical thinking skills
      - Applies ${input.frameworks.join(', ')} frameworks
      - Encourages multiple perspective analysis
      - Promotes ethical reasoning
      
      Content Requirements:
      - Realistic, engaging scenario
      - Multiple stakeholder viewpoints
      - Sufficient complexity for ${input.complexity} level
      - Clear decision points requiring analysis
      
      Include guided questions that:
      - Progress from understanding to evaluation
      - Encourage framework application
      - Promote deep analytical thinking
      - Connect to real-world implications
    `;
  }
}
```

## Educational Focus

### Learning-Centered Development

**Always Consider:**
- **Student Experience**: Will this help students learn more effectively?
- **Educator Workflow**: Does this support teaching goals and classroom management?
- **Accessibility**: Can all students use this feature regardless of ability or background?
- **Privacy**: Is student data protected and handled appropriately?

**Educational Best Practices:**
```typescript
// Good: Features that enhance learning
interface LearningAnalytics {
  practiceSessionCount: number;
  averageAnalysisDepth: number;
  frameworkMasteryLevel: Record<string, number>;
  reflectiveInsights: string[];
  progressTrends: ProgressDataPoint[];
}

// Good: Scaffolding and progressive disclosure
interface DifficultyProgression {
  currentLevel: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  suggestedNextSteps: string[];
  masteryIndicators: string[];
  supportResources: string[];
}
```

### Content Quality Standards

**Case Study Generation**
- Educational relevance and accuracy
- Appropriate complexity for target audience
- Multiple valid analytical approaches
- Cultural sensitivity and inclusiveness
- Clear learning objectives alignment

**Analysis Questions**
- Progressive difficulty (Bloom's Taxonomy)
- Framework application opportunities
- Critical thinking promotion
- Real-world application connections

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

**Unit Tests** (Individual functions and components)
```typescript
// Good: Educational logic testing
describe('CaseStudyValidator', () => {
  it('should validate minimum educational content standards', () => {
    const caseStudy = {
      content: 'A comprehensive business scenario with stakeholders...',
      questions: 'Analyze using SWOT framework...',
      complexity: 'intermediate'
    };
    
    const result = validateEducationalContent(caseStudy);
    
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(true);
    expect(result.educationalValue).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
  });
});
```

**Integration Tests** (Feature workflows)
```typescript
// Good: Educational workflow testing
describe('Practice Session Workflow', () => {
  it('should complete full student practice workflow', async () => {
    // Test complete student interaction flow
    const session = await startPracticeSession(testCaseStudy);
    await addStudentNotes(session.id, 'Analysis notes...');
    await applyFramework(session.id, 'SWOT Analysis');
    const completed = await completePracticeSession(session.id);
    
    expect(completed.analyticalQuality).toBeDefined();
    expect(completed.learningOutcomes).toHaveLength(greaterThan(0));
  });
});
```

**Educational Content Tests**
```typescript
// Good: AI-generated content validation
describe('AI Content Quality', () => {
  it('should generate educationally appropriate content', async () => {
    const input = createTestGenerationInput();
    const caseStudy = await generateCaseStudy(input);
    
    expect(caseStudy.content).toContainEducationalElements();
    expect(caseStudy.questions).toPromoteCriticalThinking();
    expect(caseStudy.complexity).toMatchRequestedLevel(input.complexity);
  });
});
```
